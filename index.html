In the grand scheme of things, there was almost no water at all—much, much less than in the air above Earth’s driest deserts. Mars’s atmosphere is also very thin and composed almost entirely of carbon dioxide. The hope of having Martian cousins was growing dimmer.</P>

A revelation seemed to come when a group of scientists announced on August 7, 1996, that they had found a meteorite from Mars in Antarctica that contained microscopic Martian fossils. Obviously that announcement launched much fanfare, public debate, and speculation. Intense study of the meteorite and its contents revealed that the “fossils” were likely the result of some natural process and not the remains of life. Nevertheless, the claimed finding spurred discussion about whether we would know how to recognize alien life if we did find it and the mother of all questions—What is life, really?</P>

The 1-ton, SUV-size machine is the largest vehicle to reach the Martian surface, requiring an elaborate sky-crane mechanism to lower it down to the ground following an infamous "seven minutes of terror," during which NASA engineers couldn't contact the robot. Curiosity is the first rover that's not solar-powered; instead, it relies on a nuclear radioisotope thermoelectric generator, which produces electricity from the heat of plutonium-238's radioactive decay. It can travel about 660 feet (200 m) per day. </h3>
